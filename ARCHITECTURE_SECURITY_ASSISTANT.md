Note: When dealing with external APIs such as ChatGPT, ensuring data privacy is especially important. The content generated should be sanitized of personal information before being sent to the external system to mitigate privacy concerns. Mitigations have been proposed to manage risks, but they can be further reinforced by following security best practices and maintaining up-to-date security measures.
