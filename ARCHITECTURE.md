# Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the AI Nutrition-Pro application, including system context, containers, and deployment views. The architecture is depicted using C4 diagrams for enhanced clarity..

## System Context diagram

```mermaid

  title System Context diagram for AI Nutrition-Pro
  Enterprise_Boundary(b0, "AI Nutrition-Pro boundary") {
    System(anps1, "AI Nutrition-Pro API Service")
  }
  Enterprise_Boundary(b1, "OpenAI") {
    System_Ext(ChatGPT, "ChatGPT", "LLM")
  }
  Enterprise_Boundary(b2, "Meal Planner A") {
    Person_Ext(n1, "Dietitian A")
    System_Ext(apa, "Meal Planner A System")
  }
  Rel(anps1, ChatGPT, "Uses for LLM featured content creation", "REST")
  Rel(n1, apa, "Uses for diet creation")
  Rel(apa, anps1, "Uses for AI content generation", "REST")
```

- AI Nutrition-Pro is API backend application that uses OpenAI ChatGPT as LLM solution. It connects to OpenAI server using REST.
- Meal Planner A is one of many Meal Planner applications that can be integrated with AI Nutrition-Pro. It connects to AI Nutrition-Pro using REST.
- Dietitian A uses Meal Planner A for making diets. For example, dietitian can generate new diet introductions based on existing ones. LLMs can create this content following personal style of dietitian.

## Containers Context diagram

    Rel(admin, app_control_plane, "Configure system properties")
    Rel(onboard_manager, app_control_plane, "Creates new tenant. Onboarding new meal planner applications")
    Rel(backend_api, chatgpt, "Utilizes ChatGPT for LLM-featured content creation", "HTTPS/REST")
