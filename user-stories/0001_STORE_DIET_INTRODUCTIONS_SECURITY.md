# (AI Generated) Security Related Acceptance Criteria
**API Gateway**
- **AC1:** The API Gateway must authenticate requests to the new API endpoint using existing API keys.
- **AC2:** The API Gateway must apply rate limiting to the new API endpoint to mitigate DoS attacks.
- **AC3:** The API Gateway must log all requests and responses to the new API endpoint for auditing purposes.

**API Application**
- **AC4:** The API Application must perform input validation for all fields in the request payload to prevent injection attacks.
