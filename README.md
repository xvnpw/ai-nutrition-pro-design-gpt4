Research project on AI usefulness in [DevSecOps](https://dsomm.owasp.org/). For **design** phase and using OpenAI **GPT-4**

## DevSecOps background

The most important DevSecOps goals are:
- shift left security
- be placed in developers ecosystem (IDE, code hosting, PRs, etc.)
- provide fast feedback and guidance

For coding phase, we have tools like [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2023/using-ai-to-write-secure-code-with-semgrep) that can benefit from AI and LLMs. What about **design** phase? Typical manual activities are: 
- security design review
- threat modelling

The aim of this research is to answer the question of whether or not the current state of LLMs can bring meaningful value to those security activities.

## Input Data & Results

Each time input data are updated, [github action](https://github.com/xvnpw/ai-threat-modeling-action) runs, query is sent to GPT-4 and results are committed back to repository as output.

Workflow can directly push into repository or create pull request. User Stories can be created as issues and bot will add comment with output.
