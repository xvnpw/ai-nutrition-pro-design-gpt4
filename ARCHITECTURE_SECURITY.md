# (AI Generated) Architecture Threat Model

### Data flow 1: Meal Planner application -> API Gateway

| Threat Id | Component name | Threat Name | STRIDE category | Explanation | How threat is already mitigated in architecture | Mitigations | Risk severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | API Gateway | Attacker spoofs Meal Planner application and sends malicious requests to API Gateway | Spoofing | The API Gateway is responsible for authenticating requests from the Meal Planner application. If an attacker can spoof the Meal Planner application, they can potentially send malicious requests to the API Gateway. | The architecture description mentions that each Meal Planner application has an individual API key for authentication. This mitigates the threat to some extent, but it's not completely foolproof if the API key is compromised. | Implement additional measures like IP whitelisting and multi-factor authentication to further secure the communication between the Meal Planner application and the API Gateway. | High |
| 2 | API Gateway | Attacker intercepts and tampers with data between Meal Planner application and API Gateway | Tampering | The data transmitted between the Meal Planner application and the API Gateway could contain sensitive information. If an attacker can intercept and tamper with this data, it could lead to serious consequences. | The architecture description mentions that the network traffic between the Meal Planner application and the API Gateway is encrypted using TLS. This mitigates the threat by making it difficult for an attacker to read or modify the data during transmission. | Regularly update and patch the TLS protocol to protect against known vulnerabilities. Also, implement a secure key management system to protect the encryption keys. | Medium |

| 2 | API Gateway | Denial of Service attack on API Gateway | Denial of Service | If an attacker is able to overwhelm the API Gateway with requests, it could cause the service to become unavailable, disrupting the data flow to the API Application. | The architecture description mentions that the API Gateway has rate limiting, which helps to prevent Denial of Service attacks. | Regularly monitor the system for unusual traffic patterns and adjust rate limiting settings as necessary. Implement additional security measures such as IP blocking for suspicious sources. | High |
| 3 | API Application | Unauthorized access to API Application | Elevation of Privilege | If an attacker is able to bypass the API Gateway and directly access the API Application, they could potentially access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions. | The architecture description does not specifically mention how this threat is mitigated. | Implement strict access controls and authentication measures for the API Application.
